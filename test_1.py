""" 
What to look for in the script output (how youâ€™ll know what broke)

open() -> True means socket opened. If open() is False check network/VPN.

read_holding(0,10) should return a list of ints OR None/exception. If it returns a list, the PLC answers holding register reads. If it returns None or EXC, the PLC either didn't answer or the request was refused.

read_coils(0,16) helps detect whether flags are coils (discrete) instead of bits inside holding registers. If coils return useful booleans, maybe MX addresses are coils not bits in registers.

write_single_register(100,4321): if this returns True and the immediate read shows 4321, PLC accepted the write. If False/None or read unchanged, write was rejected.

For MX/MB tests: parent read/write operations will reveal whether your read-modify-write approach is valid.

Try unit_id 0 and 1 â€” if one works and the other fails, it's a unit-id mismatch.

When you paste the full console, Iâ€™ll point exactly to the failing step and what to change (unit id, offset, coil vs holding, permissions).
